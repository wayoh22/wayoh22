# Hello there, my name is Ronnie and welcome to my profile!
## A little about me:

- :lacrosse:&nbsp;&nbsp; Collegiate Lacrosse Coach
- :weight_lifting_man:&nbsp;&nbsp; Former Collegiate/High School Strength & Conditioning Coach
## My story...
<p>Throughout my time as a Strength & Conditioning Coach, I came to realize I’m relentless when it comes to problem-solving. How can I best suit my athlete according to their goals? How can I make this athlete stronger whilst not taxing them too much? How can I adapt my plan for an athlete when something changes in their day-to-day? These are the type of questions I persistently asked myself.

I didn’t know it at the time, but my programming career began when I started using Microsoft Excel to write my yearly plans for athletes. Sure, it wasn’t exactly “code” but the process of using functions, macros, and pulling information from other sheets fascinated me. Connecting dots from one source to another and then finding out they all related to the same goal.

I think that was what inevitably led me to programming. The constant solving of problems to make things run more efficient; to make my job and the jobs of others easier.

In the past few months, I have been teaching myself programming languages through the means of a few beginner books, personal projects that force me to ask questions, and The Odin Project. Throughout doing this I’ve gained a wide-ranging experience in developing user-friendly and cross-functional software and applications.</p>
